##Matrix Multiplication in Map Reduce

Suppose we have a *i &times; j* matrix *M*, whose element in row *i* and column *j* will be denoted *m<sub>ij</sub>*  and a *j &times; k* matrix *N* whose element in row *j* and column *k* is donated by *n<sub>jk</sub>* then the product *P = MN* will be a *i &times; k* matrix *P* whose element in row *i* and column *k* will be donated by *p<sub>ik</sub>*, where *P(i, k) = m<sub>ij</sub> &times; n<sub>jk</sub>*.
